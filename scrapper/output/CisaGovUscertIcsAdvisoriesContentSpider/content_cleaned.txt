The BN_mod_sqrt() function in openSSL which computes a modular square root contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger an infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial-of-service attack.

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial-of-service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate. 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token). If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server s_client and verify tools have support for the -crl_download option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Backticks are used since ES6 for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex and themselves can do string interpolation the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. var a = {{.}}) since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix Template.Parse returns an error when it encounters templates like this with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1 with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped.

These attributes can be defined by adding a.gitattributes file to the repository which contains a set of file patterns and the attributes that should be set for paths matching this pattern. When parsing gitattributes multiple integer overflows can occur when there is a huge number of path patterns a huge number of attributes for a single pattern or when the declared attribute names are huge. These overflows can be triggered via a crafted.gitattributes file that may be part of the commit history. Git silently splits lines longer than 2KB when parsing gitattributes from a file but not when parsing them from the index. Consequentially the failure mode depends on whether the file exists in the working tree the index or both. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap reads and writes which may result in remote code execution. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2023-01-17 going back to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade.

This functionality is also exposed to git archivevia the export-substgitattribute. When processing the padding operators there is a integer overflow in pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit() where a size_tis stored improperly as an int and then added as an offset to a memcpy(). This overflow can be triggered directly by a user running a command which invokes the commit formatting machinery (e.g. git log --format=...). It may also be triggered indirectly through git archive via the export-subst mechanism which expands format specifiers inside of files within the repository during a git archive. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap writes which may result in arbitrary code execution. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2023-01-17 going back to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade. Users who are unable to upgrade should disable git archivein untrusted repositories.

The Python multiprocessing library when used with the forkserver start method on Linux allows pickles to be deserialized from any user in the same machine local network namespace which in many system configurations means any user on the same machine. Pickles can execute arbitrary code. Thus this allows for local user privilege escalation that any forkserver process is running as. Setting multiprocessing.util.abstract_sockets_supported to False is a workaround. The forkserver start method for multiprocessing is not the default start method. This issue is Linux specific because only Linux supports abstract namespace sockets. CPython before 3.9 does not make use of Linux abstract namespace sockets by default. Support for users manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a bugfix in 3.7.8 and 3.8.3 but users would need to make specific uncommon API calls in order to do that in CPython before 3.9. has been assigned to this vulnerability.

Please note that at the time this CVE was issued the policy was an experimental feature of Node.js. 3.2.33 A vulnerability has been identified in the Node.js (.msi version) installation process specifically affecting Windows users who install Node.js using the .msi installer. This vulnerability emerges during the repair operation where the msiexec.exe process running under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context attempts to read the %USERPROFILE% environment variable from the current user's registry. The issue arises when the path referenced by the %USERPROFILE% environment variable does not exist. In such cases the msiexec.exe process attempts to create the specified path in an unsafe manner potentially leading to the creation of arbitrary folders in arbitrary locations. The severity of this vulnerability is heightened by the fact that the %USERPROFILE% environment variable in the Windows registry can be modified by standard (or non-privileged) users. Consequently unprivileged actors including malicious entities or trojans can manipulate the environment variable key to deceive the privileged msiexec.exe process. This manipulation can result in the creation of folders in unintended and potentially malicious locations. has been assigned to this vulnerability.

A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( ). 3.2.6 An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead to an application crash. This function can be called on public keys supplied from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function but applications might call the function if there are additional security requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS 140-3. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( ). 3.2.7 There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag) this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point which is uncommon. As such this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the d2i_PKCS7() d2i_PKCS7_bio() or d2i_PKCS7_fp() functions. The result of the dereference is an application crash which could lead to a denial-of-service condition. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function however third party applications might call these functions on untrusted data. ). A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified on PKCS7 signed or signed-and-enveloped data. In case the hash algorithm used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but the implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash. The unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS enabled configuration of providers or more commonly by not loading the legacy provider. PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also by the time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call these functions however third party applications would be affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on untrusted data. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( ). 3.2.9 The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input buffer leading to a crash. Applications that use the AES-XTS algorithm on the 64 bit ARM platform can crash in rare circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm is usually used for disk encryption. The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit ARM platform will read past the end of the ciphertext buffer if the ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16byte blocks e.g. 144 bytes or 1024 bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext buffer is unmapped this will trigger a crash which results in a denial of service. If an attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext buffer being decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM the application is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue a low severity one. ). 3.2.10 schema_element defeats protective search_path changes; it was found that certain database calls in PostgreSQL could permit an authenticated attacker with elevated database-level privileges to execute arbitrary code. 3.2.8 3.2.5 ). has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( ).    could result in a information dislosure authentication bypass unauthorized modification arbitrary code execution or denial of service. Siemens reports that the following network management systems are affected: 3.2.1 A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might result in a crash which could lead to a denial-of-service condition. In theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys or sensitive plaintext) although we are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS client this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 4.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( ). 3.2.2 A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient to recover plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5 RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example in a TLS connection RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that has observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( ). 3.2.3 The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the name (e.g. CERTIFICATE) any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the name_out header and data arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial-of-service condition. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( ). 3.2.4 The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally by OpenSSL to support the SMIME CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities but may also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However in this case the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream SMIME_write_ASN1 SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include i2d_ASN1_bio_stream BIO_new_CMS BIO_new_PKCS7 i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected. has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This scenario can happen under security definer functions or when a common user and query is planned initially and then re-used across multiple SET ROLEs. Applying an incorrect policy may permit a user to complete otherwise-forbidden reads and modifications. This affects only databases that have used CREATE POLICY to define a row security policy.

Previously created connections are kept in a connection pool for reuse if they match the current setup. However certain FTP settings such as CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT CURLOPT_FTP_ALTERNATIVE_TO_USER CURLOPT_FTP_SSL_CCC and CURLOPT_USE_SSL were not included in the configuration match checks causing them to match too easily.

Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly or use any of the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP PKCS7/SMIME CMS CMP/CRMF or TS with no message size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those messages which may lead to a denial of service. An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers - most of which have no size limit. OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL type ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form which are the sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form separated by periods. When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large (these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large taking up tens or hundreds of kBs) the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long time. The time complexity is O(square(n)) with 'n' being the size of the sub-identifiers in bytes. With OpenSSL 3.0 support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names / identifiers in string form was introduced. This includes using OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching algorithms. Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure AlgorithmIdentifier which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify encrypt or decrypt or digest passed data. Applications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are affected with any version of OpenSSL. If the use is for the mere purpose of display the severity is considered low. In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer this affects the subsystems OCSP PKCS7/SMIME CMS CMP/CRMF or TS. It also impacts anything that processes X.509 certificates including simple things like verifying its signature. The impact on TLS is relatively low because all versions of OpenSSL have a 100 kB limit on the peer's certificate chain. Additionally this only impacts clients or servers that have explicitly enabled client authentication. In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 this only affects displaying diverse objects such as X.509 certificates. This is assumed to not happen in such a way that it would cause a denial of service so these versions are considered not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern and the severity is therefore considered low. has been assigned to this vulnerability.

A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that causes it to ignore empty associated data entries which are unauthenticated as a consequence. Applications that use the AES-SIV algorithm and want to authenticate empty data entries as associated data can be mislead by removing adding or reordering such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL implementation. The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the application has to call EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP_CipherUpdate()) with NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length. The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call instead of performing the associated data authentication operation. The empty data thus will not be authenticated. As this issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and we expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data entries this is qualified as low severity issue. 3.2.16 ). has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Applications that use the functions DH_check() DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a denial of service. The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value if present cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p. An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack. The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the -check option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue. 3.2.15 ). has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.

Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a denial of service. The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10000 bits in length. However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found to be too large. An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack.

Some mod_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP request smuggling attack. Configurations are affected when mod_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable substitution. Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers and cache poisoning."
