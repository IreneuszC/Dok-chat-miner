https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-046-02,"The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial-of-service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate. 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token). If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server s_client and verify tools have support for the "-crl_download" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack."

Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger an infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial-of-service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters."

For example in a TLS connection RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that has observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them.

If the function succeeds then the "name_out" "header" and "data" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial-of-service condition. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue."

It is primarily used internally by OpenSSL to support the SMIME CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities but may also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However in this case the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream SMIME_write_ASN1 SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.

This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag) this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL neither of which need to have a valid signature.

Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly or use any of the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP PKCS7/SMIME CMS CMP/CRMF or TS with no message size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those messages which may lead to a denial of service. An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers - most of which have no size limit. OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL type ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form which are the sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form separated by periods. When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large (these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large taking up tens or hundreds of kBs) the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long time. The time complexity is O(square(n)) with 'n' being the size of the sub-identifiers in bytes. With OpenSSL 3.0 support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names / identifiers in string form was introduced. This includes using OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching algorithms. Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure AlgorithmIdentifier which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify encrypt or decrypt or digest passed data. Applications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are affected with any version of OpenSSL. If the use is for the mere purpose of display the severity is considered low. In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer this affects the subsystems OCSP PKCS7/SMIME CMS CMP/CRMF or TS. It also impacts anything that processes X.509 certificates including simple things like verifying its signature. The impact on TLS is relatively low because all versions of OpenSSL have a 100 kB limit on the peer's certificate chain. Additionally this only impacts clients or servers that have explicitly enabled client authentication. In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 this only affects displaying diverse objects such as X.509 certificates. This is assumed to not happen in such a way that it would cause a denial of service so these versions are considered not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern and the severity is therefore considered low."

The AES-SIV algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated data entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the application has to call EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP_CipherUpdate()) with NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer length. The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for such a call instead of performing the associated data authentication operation. The empty data thus will not be authenticated.

https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-24-046-11,"Git is distributed revision control system. git log can display commits in an arbitrary format using its --format specifiers. This functionality is also exposed to git archive via the export-subst gitattribute. When processing the padding operators there is a integer overflow in pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit() where a size_t is stored improperly as an int and then added as an offset to a memcpy(). This overflow can be triggered directly by a user running a command which invokes the commit formatting machinery (e.g. git log --format=...). It may also be triggered indirectly through git archive via the export-subst mechanism which expands format specifiers inside of files within the repository during a git archive. This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap writes which may result in arbitrary code execution. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2023-01-17 going back to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade. Users who are unable to upgrade should disable git archive in untrusted repositories.

The Python multiprocessing library when used with the forkserver start method on Linux allows pickles to be deserialized from any user in the same machine local network namespace which in many system configurations means any user on the same machine. Pickles can execute arbitrary code. Thus this allows for local user privilege escalation that any forkserver process is running as. Setting multiprocessing.util.abstract_sockets_supported to False is a workaround. The forkserver start method for multiprocessing is not the default start method. This issue is Linux specific because only Linux supports abstract namespace sockets. CPython before 3.9 does not make use of Linux abstract namespace sockets by default. Support for users manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a bugfix in 3.7.8 and 3.8.3 but users would need to make specific uncommon API calls in order to do that in CPython before 3.9."

As ES6 template literals are rather complex and themselves can do string interpolation the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. "var a = {{.}}") since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix Template.Parse returns an error when it encounters templates like this with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1 with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution."
