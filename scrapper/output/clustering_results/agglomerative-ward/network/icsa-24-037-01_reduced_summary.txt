CISA recommends hardening HID OMNIKEY and iCLASS SE Readers from configuration changes, protecting credentials, and disabling legacy technologies to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities. Certain configuration in the communication channel for encoders could expose sensitive data, allowing attackers to read data from reader configuration cards and credentials. HID advises users to mitigate these threats by following recommended steps. Organizations should implement cybersecurity strategies and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
