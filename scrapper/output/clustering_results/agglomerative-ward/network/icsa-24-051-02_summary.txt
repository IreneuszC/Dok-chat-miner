The Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - Ethercat Zeek Plugin versions d78dda6 and prior are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read and write, which could allow an attacker to crash the Zeek process, leak information in memory, and cause arbitrary code execution. CISA recommends updating the plugin and implementing defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, but organizations should report any suspected malicious activity to CISA. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are available on the ICS webpage.
