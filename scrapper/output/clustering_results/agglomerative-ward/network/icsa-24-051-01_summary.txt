CISA recommends users protect themselves from social engineering attacks and take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Commend WS203VICM video door station. The vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information, force the system to restart, or bypass access control. Aarn Flecha Menndez of S21sec reported the vulnerabilities to CISA, and although the product is end-of-life, Commend has created new firmware to address the issues. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, but organizations should report any suspected malicious activity to CISA. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are available on the ICS webpage.
