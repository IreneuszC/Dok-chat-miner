Unauthenticated Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerabilities exist in various services accessed via the PAPI protocol, as well as multiple authenticated command injection vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could lead to the ability to interrupt normal operation, execute arbitrary commands, and establish highly privileged persistent arbitrary code execution. Siemens recommends protecting network access with appropriate mechanisms and configuring the environment according to their recommendations. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, but organizations should implement recommended cybersecurity strategies and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA.
