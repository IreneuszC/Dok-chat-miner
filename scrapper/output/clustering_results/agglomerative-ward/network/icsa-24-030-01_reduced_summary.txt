Emerson Rosemount GC370XA, GC700XA, and GC1500XA products have vulnerabilities that could allow unauthenticated users with network access to obtain sensitive information, cause denial-of-service, and bypass authentication to acquire admin capabilities. To minimize the risk of exploitation, users should update the affected products' firmware, implement cybersecurity best practices, and ensure the affected product is connected to a well-protected network and not connected to the Internet.
