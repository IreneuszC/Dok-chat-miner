CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in the FeverWarn ecosystem, an IoT-based skin temperature scanning system. The vulnerabilities include insufficiently protected cloud integration, unchangeable device credentials, improperly protected API, unauthenticated messaging, and lack of input sanitization. Users are encouraged to follow mitigation guidance and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA. FeverWarn and its associated cloud service have been discontinued, and there are no future availability or upgrades. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.
