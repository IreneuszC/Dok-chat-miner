Gessler GmbH recommends updating EZ2 to 3.2 or greater and WebMaster to 4.4 or greater to mitigate vulnerabilities reported by Limes Security to CISA. The vulnerabilities include weak hard coded credentials and a weak hashing algorithm for user passwords, which could allow an attacker to take control of the web management of the device and extract and break password hashes. No known public exploitation has been reported, and organizations are encouraged to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies and report any suspicious activity to CISA.
