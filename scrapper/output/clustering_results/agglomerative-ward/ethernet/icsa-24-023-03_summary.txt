CISA has recommended cybersecurity strategies for organizations to mitigate vulnerabilities in the ViewPower Pro UPS management software. The vulnerabilities could allow for denial-of-service attacks, obtaining administrator credentials, and remote code execution. The affected product is also vulnerable to OS command injection and unauthorized modification of the administrator account password. Users are advised to take defensive measures and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA. The vendor, Voltronic Power, did not respond to CISA's coordination attempts, and users are encouraged to contact the vendor for updates.
