Mitsubishi Electric has reported a vulnerability in their MELSEC iQ-R Series products that could allow a non-administrator user to disclose the credentials of a user with a lower access level. To prevent this, users should update their CPU module and enable communication with only the enhanced version of vulnerability management of GX Works3 when writing user information to the CPU module. Additionally, organizations should implement recommended cybersecurity strategies and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
