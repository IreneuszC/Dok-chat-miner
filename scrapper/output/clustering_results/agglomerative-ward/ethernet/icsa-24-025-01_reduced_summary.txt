CISA recommends defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in the FeverWarn ecosystem, including updating to the latest version and following established internal procedures for suspected malicious activity. The vulnerabilities could allow attackers to obtain user data, execute remote code, and gain control over devices. MachineSense devices have credentials that cannot be changed by the user or administrator, and the API is improperly protected, allowing remote access without authentication. Additionally, the devices use unauthenticated MQTT messaging and lack input sanitization, making them vulnerable to compromise.
