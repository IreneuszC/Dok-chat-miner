Multiple unauthenticated Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerabilities exist in various services accessed via the PAPI protocol, as well as authenticated command injection and arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities. Siemens has identified specific workarounds and mitigations, and recommends protecting network access and configuring the environment according to their recommendations. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, but organizations should follow established procedures and report any suspicious activity to CISA. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are available on the ICS webpage, and users are encouraged to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies. Defensive measures should be taken to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
