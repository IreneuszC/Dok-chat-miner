CISA recommends users protect themselves from social engineering attacks and addresses vulnerabilities in the Commend WS203VICM video door station. The vulnerabilities could allow attackers to obtain sensitive information, force system restarts, and bypass access control. A new firmware has been created to address the issues, and organizations are encouraged to implement cybersecurity strategies and report any suspicious activity to CISA. Additional mitigation guidance is available on the ICS webpage.
