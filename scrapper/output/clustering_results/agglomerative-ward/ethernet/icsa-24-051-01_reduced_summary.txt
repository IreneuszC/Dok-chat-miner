CISA recommends users protect themselves from social engineering attacks and take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Commend WS203VICM video door station. Vulnerabilities include the ability for an attacker to obtain sensitive information, force the system to restart, and bypass access control. Commend has created new firmware to address these issues, which can be installed via the program IP Station Config. Organizations should implement recommended cybersecurity strategies and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA.
