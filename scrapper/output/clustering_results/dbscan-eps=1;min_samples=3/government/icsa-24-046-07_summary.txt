Siemens recommends defensive measures and implementing cybersecurity strategies to minimize the risk of exploitation. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, and they are not exploitable remotely. Siemens has provided specific workarounds and mitigations to reduce the risk, and additional information on industrial security can be found in the product manuals.
