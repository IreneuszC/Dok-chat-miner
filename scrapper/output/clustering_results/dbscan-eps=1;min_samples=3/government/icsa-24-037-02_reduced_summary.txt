The article discusses a vulnerability in HID Global's iCLASS SE reader configuration cards, which could allow attackers to extract sensitive data. To mitigate this risk, administrators should update their readers and credentials with new keys, and securely destroy unneeded configuration cards. Additionally, organizations are encouraged to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA. The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely, but physical possession of the configuration cards is required for exploitation.
