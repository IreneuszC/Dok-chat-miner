CISA recommends hardening HID OMNIKEY Readers and iCLASS SE Reader Modules from configuration changes, protecting credentials, and disabling legacy technologies to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities. Certain configuration in the communication channel for encoders could expose sensitive data when reader configuration cards are programmed, allowing attackers to read data from reader configuration cards and credentials. HID advises users to mitigate these threats and implement recommended cybersecurity strategies. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported, and it is not exploitable remotely, but organizations should still report suspected malicious activity to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
