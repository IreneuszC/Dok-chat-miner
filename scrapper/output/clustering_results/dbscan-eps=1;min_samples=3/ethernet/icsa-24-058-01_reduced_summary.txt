Mitsubishi Electric has reported a denial-of-service vulnerability in their FA products, which could be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a temporary denial-of-service condition in the product's Ethernet communication. To minimize the risk of exploitation, users are recommended to implement defensive measures and update their systems. Organizations should also follow established internal procedures and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
