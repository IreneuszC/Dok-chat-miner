Siemens has reported a vulnerability to CISA, which could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain full administrative access to the application. The affected products use a hard-coded secret value for the computation of a Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code. To minimize the risk of exploitation, CISA recommends implementing defensive measures such as network access protection and configuring the IT environment according to Siemens' recommendations. Additionally, organizations should implement recommended cybersecurity strategies and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA.
