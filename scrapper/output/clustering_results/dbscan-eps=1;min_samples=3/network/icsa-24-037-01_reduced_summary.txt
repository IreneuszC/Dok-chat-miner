CISA recommends hardening HID OMNIKEY and iCLASS SE Readers from configuration changes, protecting credentials, and disabling legacy technologies to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities. Certain configuration available in the communication channel for encoders could expose sensitive data when reader configuration cards are programmed, allowing an attacker to read data from reader configuration cards and credentials. HID advises users to mitigate these threats by following recommended steps. No known public exploitation specifically targeting this vulnerability has been reported, and it is not exploitable remotely. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are available on the ICS webpage. Organizations should implement recommended cybersecurity strategies and report suspected malicious activity to CISA.
