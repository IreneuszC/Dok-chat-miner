Unauthenticated Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerabilities exist in various services accessed via the PAPI protocol, as well as multiple authenticated command injection vulnerabilities. There are also vulnerabilities allowing an attacker to establish highly privileged persistent arbitrary code execution across boot cycles. Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms and configuring the environment according to their recommendations. Organizations should implement recommended cybersecurity strategies and follow established internal procedures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.
