Unauthenticated Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerabilities exist in various services accessed via the PAPI protocol, including CLI, BLE daemon, Wi-Fi Uplink, and soft ap daemon. There are also multiple authenticated command injection vulnerabilities and an authenticated vulnerability allowing highly privileged persistent arbitrary code execution. Siemens has identified specific workarounds and mitigations for these vulnerabilities. Additionally, there are arbitrary file deletion vulnerabilities and buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the underlying services, which could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution. Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices and configuring the environment according to their recommendations. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, but organizations should follow established procedures and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA. CISA encourages implementing recommended cybersecurity strategies and defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are available on the ICS webpage.
