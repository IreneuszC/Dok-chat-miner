CISA recommends users to take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in the FeverWarn ecosystem. These measures include following established internal procedures, reporting suspected malicious activity to CISA, and protecting themselves from social engineering attacks. The vulnerabilities in the FeverWarn ecosystem could allow attackers to obtain user data, execute remote code, gain control over devices, and access sensitive information without authentication. The vulnerabilities have been assigned CVSS v3 base scores ranging from 7.5 to 10.0.
