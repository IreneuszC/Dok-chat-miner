Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in Siemens products, including null pointer dereference, stack overflow, and out of bounds write vulnerabilities while parsing specially crafted SPP, WRL, and PSOBJ files. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to crash the application, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service conditions. Siemens has assigned CVSS v3 and v4 base scores to these vulnerabilities and recommends defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, and they are not exploitable remotely. Siemens has also provided specific workarounds and mitigations to reduce the risk. CISA recommends implementing cybersecurity strategies and following established internal procedures to report any suspected malicious activity.
