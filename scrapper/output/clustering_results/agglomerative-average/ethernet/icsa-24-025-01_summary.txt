CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in the FeverWarn ecosystem, an IoT-based skin temperature scanning system. The vulnerabilities include insufficiently protected cloud integration, unchangeable credentials, unprotected API access, unauthenticated messaging, and Wi-Fi host configuration. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, but users are encouraged to follow mitigation guidance and report any suspicious activity to CISA. FeverWarn and its associated cloud service have been discontinued, and MachineSense is not aware of any current users. The vulnerabilities were reported by Vera Mens of Claroty Research.
