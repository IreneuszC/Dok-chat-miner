Siemens has identified several vulnerabilities in their products and has recommended specific workarounds and mitigations to reduce the risk. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the affected device, cause denial of service, or remotely login as root. Siemens has reported these vulnerabilities to CISA and has assigned CVSS v3 base scores to each vulnerability. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, but organizations are encouraged to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies to minimize the risk of exploitation. Additional information and mitigation guidance can be found on the Siemens website and the ICS webpage.
