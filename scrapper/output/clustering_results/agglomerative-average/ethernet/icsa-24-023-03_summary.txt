CISA has recommended cybersecurity strategies for organizations to implement, with additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices available on the ICS webpage. The technical information paper advises users to take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in ViewPower Pro UPS management software. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to create a denial-of-service condition, obtain administrator credentials, or achieve remote code execution. Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should report findings to CISA. The affected product is vulnerable to OS command injection and allows an unauthenticated user to modify the administrator account password. Simon Janz of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA, and Voltronic Power did not respond to CISA's attempts at coordination. Users of Voltronic Power products are encouraged to contact the company and keep their systems up to date.
