CISA recommends implementing cybersecurity strategies and best practices to mitigate reported vulnerabilities in Westermo's Lynx 206-F2G industrial Ethernet switch. The vulnerabilities could allow attackers to inject arbitrary code, execute malicious requests, and obtain sensitive information. CISA also advises protection against social engineering attacks and encourages reporting of suspicious activity. The vulnerabilities have been assigned CVSS scores and could potentially affect the correct functioning of the device. Additional mitigation guidance is available on the ICS webpage.
