CISA recommends implementing cybersecurity strategies to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) management software. The vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to create a denial-of-service condition, obtain administrator credentials, or achieve remote code execution. Organizations should follow established internal procedures and report suspected malicious activity to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. Users of affected products are encouraged to contact the manufacturer and keep their systems up to date.
