CISA recommends users protect themselves from social engineering attacks and addresses vulnerabilities in the Commend WS203VICM video door station. The vulnerabilities could allow attackers to obtain sensitive information, force system restarts, and bypass access control. A new firmware has been created to address the issues, and users are advised to follow defensive measures to minimize risk. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, and organizations are encouraged to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are available on the ICS webpage.
