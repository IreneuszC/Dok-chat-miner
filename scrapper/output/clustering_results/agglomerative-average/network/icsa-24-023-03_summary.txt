CISA has recommended cybersecurity strategies for organizations to implement, with additional guidance and practices available on the ICS webpage. They have also identified vulnerabilities in ViewPower Pro, an Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) management software, and have assigned CVSS v3 base scores to each vulnerability. Organizations are advised to follow internal procedures and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA. The affected product, Voltronic Power, did not respond to CISA's attempts at coordination, and users are encouraged to contact Voltronic Power and keep their systems up to date.
