CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in the FeverWarn ecosystem, an IoT-based skin temperature scanning system. The vulnerabilities include insufficiently protected cloud integration, unchangeable credentials, unprotected API access, unauthenticated messaging, and Wi-Fi host configuration. These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to obtain user data, execute remote code, gain control over devices, and perform malicious actions. FeverWarn and its associated cloud service have been discontinued, and MachineSense is not aware of any current users. Users are encouraged to follow mitigation guidance and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported at this time.
