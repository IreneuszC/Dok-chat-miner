CISA recommends users to take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in the FeverWarn ecosystem. Users should follow established internal procedures and report suspected malicious activity to CISA. The vulnerabilities could allow attackers to obtain user data, execute remote code, gain control over devices, and access sensitive information without authentication. MachineSense devices have credentials that cannot be changed by the user or administrator, and the cloud provider used for integration and deployment is insufficiently protected against unauthorized access. Users of the affected product are encouraged to discontinue use, as there will be no future availability or upgrades.
