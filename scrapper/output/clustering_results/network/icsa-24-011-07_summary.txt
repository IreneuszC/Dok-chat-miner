CISA advises organizations to conduct impact analysis and risk assessment before deploying defensive measures. Siemens recommends updating to V23Q4 or later to mitigate the risk of a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code and gain root access. CISA will no longer update ICS security advisories for Siemens product vulnerabilities after January 10, 2023. No known public exploitation of the vulnerability has been reported, and it is not exploitable remotely. CISA offers cyber defense best practices and encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies.
