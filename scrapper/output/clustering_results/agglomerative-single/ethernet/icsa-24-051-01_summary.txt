CISA recommends users protect themselves from social engineering attacks and addresses vulnerabilities in the Commend WS203VICM video door station. The vulnerabilities could allow attackers to obtain sensitive information, force system restarts, and bypass access control. A new firmware has been created to address the issues, and users are advised to take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, and organizations observing suspicious activity should report findings to CISA. CISA encourages the implementation of recommended cybersecurity strategies and provides additional mitigation guidance on their ICS webpage.
