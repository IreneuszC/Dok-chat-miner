Unauthenticated Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerabilities exist in various services accessed via the PAPI protocol, as well as multiple authenticated command injection vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could lead to the interruption of normal operation of affected access points and the execution of arbitrary commands as a privileged user. Siemens has identified specific workarounds and mitigations for users to reduce risk. Additionally, there are arbitrary file deletion vulnerabilities and buffer overflow vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution. Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms and configuring the environment according to their recommendations. No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, but organizations should follow established internal procedures and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are available on the ICS webpage, and CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies. Defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities include applying patches and updates, restricting network access, and following the recommendations in the product manuals.
