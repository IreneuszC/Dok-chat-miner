CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in the FeverWarn ecosystem, an IoT-based skin temperature scanning system. These measures include following mitigation guidance and recommended practices, reporting suspected malicious activity to CISA, and protecting themselves from social engineering attacks. The vulnerabilities include insufficiently protected cloud integration, unchangeable credentials, improperly protected API, unauthenticated messaging, and configuration issues that could allow attackers to compromise the devices. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, and the FeverWarn product has been discontinued with no future availability or upgrades.
