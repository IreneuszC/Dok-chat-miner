CISA has recommended cybersecurity strategies for organizations to implement, with additional guidance and practices available on their website. They have also identified vulnerabilities in ViewPower Pro, an Uninterruptable Power Supply management software, which could allow for denial-of-service attacks, obtaining administrator credentials, and remote code execution. CISA recommends defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation and encourages organizations to report any suspected malicious activity. The vulnerabilities were reported by Simon Janz of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative, and Voltronic Power did not respond to CISA's attempts at coordination. Users of Voltronic Power products are advised to keep their systems up to date.
