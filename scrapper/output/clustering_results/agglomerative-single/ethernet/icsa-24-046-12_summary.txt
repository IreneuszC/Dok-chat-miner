Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms and configuring the IT environment according to product manuals. Siemens has identified vulnerabilities in the RPC communication protocol in certain products, which could allow for denial-of-service attacks. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, and they are not exploitable remotely. Organizations are encouraged to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies and defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation. Additional information and mitigation guidance can be found on the Siemens and CISA websites.
