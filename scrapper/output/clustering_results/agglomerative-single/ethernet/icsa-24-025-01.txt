CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically users should: .  on the ICS webpage at .  including . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at for additional information. in the technical information paper Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks: No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.  and this policy.  . FeverWarn and the associated cloud service were pandemic-specific products for elevated body temperature scanning discontinued by MachineSense prior to the end of the pandemic. They are no longer available and there will be no future availability or upgrades. MachineSense is not aware of any current users of FeverWarn. Users of the affected product are encouraged to  could allow an attacker to obtain user data from devices execute remote code on devices or gain control over devices to perform malicious actions. ). The cloud provider MachineSense uses for integration and deployment for multiple MachineSense devices such as the programmable logic controller (PLC) PumpSense PowerAnalyzer FeverWarn and others is insufficiently protected against unauthorized access. An attacker with access to the internal procedures could view source code secret credentials and more. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.7 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( ). Multiple MachineSense devices have credentials unable to be changed by the user or administrator. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( ). The MachineSense application programmable interface (API) is improperly protected and can be accessed without authentication. A remote attacker could retrieve and modify sensitive information without any authentication. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( ). MachineSense devices use unauthenticated MQTT messaging to monitor devices and remote viewing of sensor data by users. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( ). MachineSense FeverWarn devices are configured as Wi-Fi hosts in a way that attackers within range could connect to the device's web services and compromise the device. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( ). MachineSense FeverWarn Raspberry Pi-based devices lack input sanitization which could allow an attacker on an adjacent network to send a message running commands or could overflow the stack. has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ( ; . Vera Mens of Claroty Research reported these vulnerabilities to CISA. The following components of the FeverWarn ecosystem an IoT-based skin temperature scanning system are affected:
