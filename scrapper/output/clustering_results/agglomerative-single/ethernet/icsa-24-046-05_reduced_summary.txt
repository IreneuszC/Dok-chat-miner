Siemens reported a vulnerability to CISA, which could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain full administrative access to the application. The affected products use a hard-coded secret value for the computation of a Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code. To minimize the risk of exploitation, CISA recommends protecting network access with appropriate mechanisms and implementing recommended cybersecurity strategies. Additionally, organizations should follow established internal procedures and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA.
