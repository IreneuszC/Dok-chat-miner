CISA recommends users to protect themselves from social engineering attacks and to take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Commend WS203VICM video door station. The vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information, force the system to restart, or bypass access control. Commend has created new firmware to address the issues, and users are advised to follow recommended cybersecurity strategies and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA.
