Siemens has reported vulnerabilities in their Parasolid products, which could allow attackers to crash the application, execute code, and perform remote code execution. Siemens recommends updating to the latest versions of the affected products and not opening untrusted XT files in Parasolid. They also advise protecting network access and configuring the environment according to security policy. No known public exploitation has been reported, but organizations should follow established procedures and report any suspicious activity to CISA. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are available on the ICS webpage and in the product manuals.
