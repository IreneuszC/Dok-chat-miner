HID Global has reported a vulnerability in their iCLASS SE reader configuration cards, which could allow sensitive data to be extracted. To mitigate the risk, administrators should securely destroy unneeded configuration cards and take steps to update readers and credentials with new keys. Additionally, organizations should implement recommended cybersecurity strategies and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.
