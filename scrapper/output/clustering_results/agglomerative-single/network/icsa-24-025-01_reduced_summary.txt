CISA recommends users to take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in the FeverWarn ecosystem. These measures include following established internal procedures, protecting against social engineering attacks, and discontinuing the use of the affected product. The vulnerabilities in the ecosystem could allow attackers to obtain user data, execute remote code, gain control over devices, and access sensitive information without authentication. These vulnerabilities have been reported to CISA by Vera Mens of Claroty Research.
