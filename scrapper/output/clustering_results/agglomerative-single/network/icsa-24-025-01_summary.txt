CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in the FeverWarn ecosystem, an IoT-based skin temperature scanning system. The vulnerabilities include unauthenticated access to the MachineSense API, unchangeable credentials on multiple devices, and insufficient protection of the cloud provider used for integration and deployment. Users are encouraged to follow mitigation guidance and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA. Additionally, MachineSense has discontinued the FeverWarn product and there will be no future availability or upgrades.
