CISA recommends hardening HID OMNIKEY and iCLASS SE Readers from configuration changes, protecting credentials, and disabling legacy technologies to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities. Certain configuration in the communication channel for encoders could expose sensitive data when reader configuration cards are programmed, allowing attackers to read data and create malicious configuration cards or credentials. HID advises users to mitigate these threats by following recommended steps. No known public exploitation targeting this vulnerability has been reported, and it is not exploitable remotely, but organizations should still implement recommended cybersecurity strategies and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA.
