CISA has recommended cybersecurity strategies to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in the ViewPower Pro UPS management software. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to create a denial-of-service condition, obtain administrator credentials, or achieve remote code execution. Organizations are advised to follow established internal procedures and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. Users of Voltronic Power products are encouraged to contact the company and keep their systems up to date.
