CISA has recommended cybersecurity strategies for organizations to implement, with additional guidance available on the ICS webpage. They have also provided mitigation guidance for vulnerabilities in ViewPower Pro UPS management software, including potential denial-of-service attacks, obtaining administrator credentials, and remote code execution. The affected product is vulnerable to OS command injection and allows an unauthenticated user to modify the administrator account password. Simon Janz of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA, and Voltronic Power did not respond to coordination attempts. Users are encouraged to keep their systems up to date and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA.
