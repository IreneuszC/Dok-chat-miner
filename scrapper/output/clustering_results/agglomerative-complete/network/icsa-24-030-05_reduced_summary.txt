The article discusses a Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability in Rockwell Automation ControlLogix and GuardLogix programmable logic controllers, which could lead to a major nonrecoverable fault. The recommended solution is for users to apply risk mitigations and implement security best practices to minimize the risk of exploitation. CISA also recommends defensive measures to minimize the risk of vulnerability, and organizations are encouraged to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA.
