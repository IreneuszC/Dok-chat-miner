Unauthenticated Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerabilities exist in various services accessed via the PAPI protocol, as well as multiple authenticated command injection vulnerabilities and an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability. These vulnerabilities could lead to the interruption of normal operation and the execution of arbitrary code on the affected access points. Siemens has identified specific workarounds and mitigations, and recommends protecting network access and configuring the environment according to their recommendations. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, but organizations are encouraged to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies and defensive measures. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are available on the ICS webpage.
