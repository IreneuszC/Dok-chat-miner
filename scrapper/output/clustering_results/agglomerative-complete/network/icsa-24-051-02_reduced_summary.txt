Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - Ethercat Zeek Plugin versions d78dda6 and prior are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read and write, which could allow an attacker to crash the Zeek process, leak information in memory, and cause arbitrary code execution. To reduce the risk of exploitation, users are recommended to update the plugin, keep critical software updates and patches up to date, and implement recommended cybersecurity strategies. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, but organizations should report any suspected malicious activity to CISA.
