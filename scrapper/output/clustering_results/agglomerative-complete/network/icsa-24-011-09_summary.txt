Siemens has identified several vulnerabilities in their products and has recommended specific workarounds and mitigations to reduce the risk of exploitation. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the affected device, cause denial of service, or remotely login as root. Siemens has assigned CVSS v3 base scores to each vulnerability and has reported them to CISA. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, but organizations are encouraged to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies to minimize the risk. Additional information and mitigation guidance can be found on Siemens' industrial security webpage and in their security advisory SSA-777015.
