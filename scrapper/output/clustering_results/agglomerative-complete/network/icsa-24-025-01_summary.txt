CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in the FeverWarn ecosystem, an IoT-based skin temperature scanning system. The vulnerabilities include insufficiently protected cloud integration, unchangeable credentials, unprotected API, unauthenticated MQTT messaging, and Wi-Fi host configuration. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, and FeverWarn has been discontinued by MachineSense. Users are encouraged to follow mitigation guidance and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA.
