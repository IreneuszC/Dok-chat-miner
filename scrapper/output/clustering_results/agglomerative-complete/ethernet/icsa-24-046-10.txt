CISA encourages organizations to implement recommended cybersecurity strategies for . Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at in the technical information paper . Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks: No known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time. These vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.  and this  ; . ).   policy. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities such as: . has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( A CVSS v4 score has also been calculated for . A base score of 7.3 has been assigned; the CVSS vector string is ( ). Siemens reported these vulnerabilities to CISA. Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce risk: ). As a general security measure Siemens recommends protecting network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. To operate the devices in a protected IT environment Siemens recommends configuring the environment according to . Additionally Siemens recommends that customers do not open untrusted Catia MODEL files from using Simcenter Femap. and The affected application is vulnerable to uninitialized pointer access while parsing specially crafted Catia MODEL files. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-22060) . and following recommendations in the product manuals.
