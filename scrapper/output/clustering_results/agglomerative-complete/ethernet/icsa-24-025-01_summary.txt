CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in the FeverWarn ecosystem, an IoT-based skin temperature scanning system. These vulnerabilities include insufficiently protected cloud integration, unchangeable device credentials, unprotected API access, unauthenticated messaging, and Wi-Fi host configuration. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, and FeverWarn has been discontinued by MachineSense. Organizations observing suspicious activity should report findings to CISA.
