AVEVA PI Server versions 2023 and 2018 SP3 P05 and prior contain vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to crash the product or throttle memory, leading to a partial denial-of-service condition. AVEVA recommends applying security updates and defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation. No known public exploitation has been reported, and all affected versions can be fixed by upgrading to AVEVA PI Server version 2023 Patch 1 or later.
