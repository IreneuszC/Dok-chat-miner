CISA has recommended cybersecurity strategies for organizations to mitigate vulnerabilities in the ViewPower Pro UPS management software. The vulnerabilities could allow for denial-of-service attacks, obtaining administrator credentials, and remote code execution. CISA has assigned CVSS v3 base scores to the vulnerabilities and encourages organizations to follow internal procedures and report any suspected malicious activity. The affected product is vulnerable to OS command injection and allows an unauthenticated user to modify the administrator account password. The vulnerabilities were reported by Simon Janz of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative, and Voltronic Power did not respond to CISA's coordination attempts. Users are advised to contact Voltronic Power and keep their systems up to date.
