Multiple industrial control systems, including products from Siemens, Rockwell Automation, Mitsubishi Electric, Crestron, and others, have been identified with vulnerabilities that could allow for denial-of-service attacks, remote code execution, and unauthorized access. These vulnerabilities have been reported to CISA, and the companies have provided workarounds, mitigations, and recommended cybersecurity strategies to minimize the risk of exploitation. No known public exploitation targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported, but organizations are encouraged to implement defensive measures and report any suspicious activity to CISA. Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are available on the ICS webpage.
