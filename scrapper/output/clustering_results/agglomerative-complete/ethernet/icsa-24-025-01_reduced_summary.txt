CISA recommends users to take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of vulnerabilities in the FeverWarn ecosystem. Users should follow established internal procedures and report suspected malicious activity to CISA. The vulnerabilities could allow attackers to obtain user data, execute remote code, and gain control over devices. MachineSense devices have credentials that cannot be changed by the user or administrator, and the API is improperly protected. Additionally, the devices use unauthenticated MQTT messaging and lack input sanitization, making them vulnerable to attacks.
