HID Global has reported a vulnerability in their iCLASS SE reader configuration cards, which could lead to the extraction of sensitive data. To mitigate this risk, administrators should securely destroy unneeded configuration cards and take steps to update readers and credentials with new keys. Additionally, organizations should implement recommended cybersecurity strategies and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely, but organizations should still take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation.
