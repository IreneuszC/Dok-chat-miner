HID Global has reported a vulnerability in their iCLASS SE reader configuration cards, which could allow sensitive data to be extracted. To mitigate the risk, administrators should securely destroy unneeded configuration cards and take steps to update readers and credentials with new keys. Customers are advised to contact HID for more information on the free upgrade to the Elite Key program. It is important to restrict access to configuration cards and implement recommended cybersecurity strategies to minimize the risk of exploitation.
