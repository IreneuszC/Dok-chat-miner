The article discusses a vulnerability in HID Global's iCLASS SE reader configuration cards, which could allow attackers to extract sensitive data such as credential and device administrator keys. To mitigate this risk, administrators are advised to securely destroy unneeded configuration cards and update readers and credentials with new keys. Additionally, organizations should implement recommended cybersecurity strategies and report any suspected malicious activity to CISA. The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely, but physical possession of the configuration cards is required for exploitation.
