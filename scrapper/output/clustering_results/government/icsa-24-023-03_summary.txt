The ViewPower Pro UPS management software is vulnerable to OS command injection, allowing for remote code execution. It also allows an unauthenticated user to modify the administrator account password and may stop processing when receiving a certain message. The software deserializes untrusted data without verification, potentially leading to denial-of-service, obtaining administrator credentials, or remote code execution. Voltronic Power did not respond to coordination attempts by CISA, and users are encouraged to contact the company and keep their systems up to date. No known public exploitation of these vulnerabilities has been reported, but organizations should follow established procedures and report any suspicious activity to CISA. Mitigation guidance and recommended practices are available on the ICS webpage, and organizations are encouraged to implement cybersecurity strategies and best practices.
