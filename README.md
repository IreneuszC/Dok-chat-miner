# Dok chat miner

## About this project
The goal of this project is to get articles from [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov) and group them using different algorithms. After grouping documents we are creating summarization of those groups and then we are evaluating those summarizations.

To achieve this goal we are using tools: 
* [scrapper](./scrapper)
* [summarizer](./summarizer)
* [evaluator](./evaluator)

**Articles, summaries, evaluation and report .csv**
* [Results!](./scrapper/output/clustering_results)
